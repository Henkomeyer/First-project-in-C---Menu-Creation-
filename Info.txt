This was a group project that we created in our 1st year of varsity 

We had the instructions of creating a console based menu for a local take-away restruant with the following being expected from the Project : 
- Login- User local repo 
- User needs to see his total and what he ordered- 
- User needs to have the abillity to clear his order and start a new order- 

We added a couple of extra features for the project.... 

The default login and password is 
Login : admin 
Password : admin 

i do apologize for the unhandled exceptions.. in 1st year we focused more on the functional C# without exception handling. 
This was a fairly simple project but challenging in ways with regards to the fact that this was our first hands-on group project for C#
Hope you enjoy...
