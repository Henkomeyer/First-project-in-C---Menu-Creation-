This was a group project that we created in our 1st year of varsity 

We had the instructions of creating a console based menu for a local take-away restruant with the following being expected from the Project : 
- Login- User local repo 
- User needs to see his total and what he ordered- 
- User needs to have the abillity to clear his order and start a new order- 

We added a couple of extra features for the project.... 

The default login and password is
